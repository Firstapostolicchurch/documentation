===================================
Create leads manually or from email
===================================

*Leads*, and *opportunities*, can be added to the *CRM* app in several ways.

First, ensure the leads feature is enabled on the database by navigating to :menuselection:`CRM app
--> Configuration --> Settings`. Tick the :guilabel:`Leads` checkbox, then click :guilabel:`Save`.

Configure email aliases
=======================

Each sales team has the option to create and utilize their own unique email alias. When messages
are sent to this address, a lead, or an opportunity, is created with the information from the
message.

To create or update a sales teams' email alias, navigate to :menuselection:`CRM app -->
Configuration --> Sales Teams`. Click on a team from the list to open the team's details page.

In the :guilabel:`Email Alias` field, enter a name for the email alias, or edit the existing name.
In the :guilabel:`Accept Emails From` field, use the drop-down menu to alter who is allowed to send
messages to this email alias.

Manually create leads
=====================

Leads can be added directly to the *CRM* app by manually creating a new record. Navigate to
:menuselection:`CRM app --> Leads` to view a list of existing leads.

.. tip::
   Leads can also be added to through the :doc:`Generate Leads <lead_mining>` button.

At the top-left of the list, click :guilabel:`New` to open a blank :guilabel:`Leads` form.

In the first field of the new form, enter a title for the new lead. Next, enter a :guilabel:`Contact
Name`, and a :guilabel:`Company Name`.

.. note::
   If this lead is :doc:`converted to an opportunity <convert>`, the :guilabel:`Company Name` field
   is used to either link this opportunity to an existing customer, or to create a new customer.
